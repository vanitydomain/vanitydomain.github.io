title: Making Direction and Taking Direction
---
I've started a blog. I was going to start with a meta post about blogging
and thinking out loud about the sorts of things I might write, but that can
wait for the next post.

The design is very retro/basic but there have been several yak shaves
to get to this point so it will definitely do for now.

Since I have not yet set out my bona fides you can take all this with whatever
size grain of salt you want.

A thought was jolted during a discussion with colleagues earlier - when you
are not taking directions, and are in situations where you are leading, there
will be an increased sense of uncertainty. That can be productive.

Part of levelling up in leadership is tackling that uncertainty and providing
direction to others.  I am referring to that as Making Direction instead of 
"Setting Direction" to try and focus on leadership and collaboration, rather 
than make it sound like instructions from management.

People will have varying amounts of freedom to Make Direction for themselves 
and others. They will Take Direction along with a set of constraints within 
which they should be working. When you have less experience you will be taking 
directions more than you will be making directions - this is a useful constraint 
during those stages of learning. You might have just a little bit of space to
make direction for yourself as part of enabling your personal development. 

There is unlikely to be a time when someone is not ever taking on direction,
but as you become more senior those directions can be quite abstract.  You'll
find yourself making direction for yourself and others, from increasingly broad 
directions.
 
It's important to listen to and channel uncertainty. Use tools like 
[5 Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys). Incidentally the 5 Whys is
such a useful tool in a whole host of situations.

A short list of some uncertanties
 * There's loads of stuff to do - am I prioritising my time on the right 
   things?
 * Are there other things to do that would be a better use of time? - how to 
   identify or plan for the unknown unknowns
 * As a team we need to get over there - is what we are doing now leading us 
   in that direction?
 * Taking a potentially vague direction that you have been given, refining it 
   and making a more concrete direction for the team - outlining constraints 
   for them to work within
 * What are the issues that may be hindering the team's ability to deliver? 
 * What have I actually achieved today?

## An aside - _what have I actually achieved today?_
There are frequently times when I have finished a day's work and on initial
reflection it's difficult or impossible to point to a specific achievement. 
That can be particularly challenging on the days that are like whirlwinds and
the modest tasks I have set for myself remain undone whilst my inbox increases.
However, and it's a very big however, my primary role is to enable others
to deliver and that is largely about communication in one form of other.  The
achievements are not always day to day but week to month to quarter to sometimes
longer. Helping and enabling people and teams to deliver, as well as nurturing
individual growth is immensely rewarding and all the hard work and effort is 
worth it.

A hasty analogy might be bakers (individual contributors) vs gardeners
(leaders). They're not the same types of work and the rewards are
on completely different timescales.
